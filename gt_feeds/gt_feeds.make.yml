# Drush Make file for Greatist Feeds module.

# Example makefile
# ----------------
# This is an example makefile to introduce new users of drush make to the
# syntax and options available to drush make.

# This make file is a working makefile - try it! Any line starting with a `#`
# is a comment.

# Core version
# ------------
# Each makefile should begin by declaring the core version of Drupal that all
# projects should be compatible with.

core: "7.x"

# API version
# ------------
# Every makefile needs to declare it's Drush Make API version. This version of
# drush make uses API version `2`.

api: 2

# Core project
# ------------
# In order for your makefile to generate a full Drupal site, you must include
# a core project. This is usually Drupal core, but you can also specify
# alternative core projects like Pressflow. Note that makefiles included with
# install profiles *should not* include a core project.

# Use Pressflow instead of Drupal core:
# projects:
#   pressflow:
#     type: "core"
#     download:
#       type: "file"
#       url: "http://launchpad.net/pressflow/6.x/6.15.73/+download/pressflow-6.15.73.tar.gz"
#
# Git clone of Drupal 7.x. Requires the `core` property to be set to 7.x.
# projects
#   drupal:
#     type: "core"
#     download:
#       url: "http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git"

projects:
  drupal:
    version: ~

  # Projects
  # --------
  # Each project that you would like to include in the makefile should be
  # declared under the `projects` key. The simplest declaration of a project
  # looks like this:

  # To include the most recent views module:

  views:
    version: ~

  # This will, by default, retrieve the latest recommended version of the
  # project using its update XML feed on Drupal.org. If any of those defaults
  # are not desirable for a project, you will want to use the keyed syntax
  # combined with some options.

  # If you want to retrieve a specific version of a project:

  # projects:
  #   views: "2.16"

  # Or an alternative, extended syntax:

  ctools:
    version: "1.3"

  # Clone a project from github.

  gt_feeds:
    type: "module"
    download:
      # type: "git" # Note, 'git' is the default, no need to specify.
      url: "git@github.com:rallen-temp/code-interview.git"
      subdir: "custom"
      # revision: "7.x-3.x"
      # revision: "2fe932c"
      branch: "master"

# If all projects or libraries share common attributes, the `defaults`
# array can be used to specify these globally, rather than
# per-project.

defaults:
  projects:
    subdir: "contrib"
