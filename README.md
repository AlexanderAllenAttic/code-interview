Interview code example for Greatist.

## Challenge Request:

Hi Richard,
Guillermo requested you to review this code test/challenge.

## Challenge Specs:

Client wants a set of urls to pull an xml feed of content from the site in the form

    /feed/<content_type>/<taxonomy_vocabulary_name>/<term_names>
 
Can pull only 1 content type from 1 vocabulary but many terms
 
Create a module / api that will accomplish this so that when I hit the url i get an xml feed of content. I should get 10 articles by default, but the number of results should be configurable somehow. Whether thats another parameter in the url or a general configuration page is up to you.
 
i.e. `/feed/article/categories/news|fitness|health`
 
returns by default 10 nodes of type article tagged with the terms news or fitness or health from the categories vocabulary.
 
proper validation should be used where appropriate and the results should reflect any non valid inputs however you deem necessary.
 
Feel free to ask any questions.
